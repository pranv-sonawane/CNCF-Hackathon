# CNCF-Hackathon

# WEB GAME 

we have built a simple website using HTML,CSS and javascript that lets the user play 2 different games.but,
you might be thinking, this is just a website which consists of some games,which, are also coded with HTML,CSS and javascript!


our main aim of creating this project is not to crate a platform where users can game on the browser itself without downloading anything, this simple front-end website is not the main element of our project. It is the use of kubernetes and the resources provided.

we could have just made an interactive website, or an app,
but we chose to use kubernetes because it was a concept that was new to our whole team, and we wanted this hackathon to be a learning experience for all of us.ðŸ˜Š
